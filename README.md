Token Address: 8cgPQfj23pNRvmjdHmKwDbavYJbbNsXyEdRstHKepump

This token used to mint card NFTs in Intersec.

According to pump.fun, the total volume is 1B and ~20% will be perma locked inside the liquidity pool.

When you buy any NFT w/ $INT, all the $INT you paid will be burnt. If you buy NFT w/ SOL, they will go to me. So you have the choice!

Go for it if you're interested or wanna buy me a coffee :)
